## Save File

### Details

When you Save in Rince DCS a JSON file is created, the default naming standard is **"MyFileName.json"**.

JSON files are human readable so you can open this file in any text editor to view/make changes.
Some of the changes you may want to make are mass changes to button sizes/locations etc.

The file also contains the embeded Image(s) that you selected on the edit Joysticks page.

The goal is to save all content in one file for ease of management.
