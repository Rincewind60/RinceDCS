### Background

Rince DCS can be used to edit Joystick layouts as long as initally the Joystick is plugged into the computer.

Once your Rince DCS file is saved you can unplug the Joystick and still open Rince DCS and edit it as the details of the Joystick are saved in the file.

Editing Joystick layouts is independent of DCS Game Instances.

Rince DCS remmebers the last file saved/opened and will open it automatically when it is started.

Viewing commands assigned to Joystick layouts requires you to choose a DCS Instance and the Aircraft you wish to view.

### Limitations

1. Will not work while DCS is running as it cannot access some of the files it needs as DCS has a lock on them.

1. Make sure your joysticks are plugged in.
1. On the [Edit Joysticks Page](EditJoysticks.md) configure your Joystick layouts.
